# Description
This is a hobby project, of trying to recreate/reverse-engineer googles "Notebook LLM", where there is a feature for creating a podcast from an uploaded PDF, since they are only able to do it in English, then I'm trying to do it, where danish is available.

# Tech Stack
The following technologies that I'm using
- OLLAMA (LLM)
- Corqui-TTS (TTS)
- Blazor (Frontend)
- Docker
